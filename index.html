        <!--this is a bio I wrote a long time ago. It's very outdated.-->
    <p class="text">Kevin Adamski is on a constant search for eureka moments. An aspiring theatrical director, actor and playwright, 
        he seeks to stir the creative spark in himself and his peers. His past projects include directing Sarah Ruhl’s Dead Man’s Cell Phone, 
        and assistant directing productions of Shakespeare’s Richard III and Vaclav Havel’s The Memorandum. In June of 2013 he graduated from UC Davis Magna Cum Laude, 
        achieving high honors with the completion of his honors project, "Integrating Dramatic Arts and Communications in the Craft of Stage Directing and Peer Leadership" </p>

    <p class="text">In university, Kevin worked extensively with the Dead Arts Society, a club dedicated to producing original works of student written theatre. 
        Kevin helped found the club in 2010 and serves as both publicity designer and leader of semiweekly writers workshops through which he guides undergraduates, 
        including first time writers, through the script writing process. He has directed for the club six times and has written scripts on topics ranging 
        from the collapse of reality to the dog-eat-dog world of campus bake sales. </p>

    <p class="text">Kevin studied directing under Bay Area director Susannah Martin and television director Sarah Pia Anderson. 
        His acting professors included renowned Stanislavsky scholar Bella Merlin and Broadway director Mindy Cooper. 
        Through UC Davis’s Granada program, he performed in productions directed by multiple global artists including New York director Michael Barakiva’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, 
        Welsh playwright Lucy Gough’s Hinterland, and Manchester di
        rector Anna Fenemore’s The Matter of Taste. Working with these artists exposed Kevin to new, exciting directing styles which helped him sculpt his craft. </p>

    <p class="text">Kevin continued to hone is directing style serving as a Directing and Marketing Apprentice for Sacramento's Capital Stage, a company dedicated to producing bold, intimate works of theater. He served as assistant director for various prominent California artists including Stephanie Gularte, Janis Stevens, Peter Mohrmann, and Jonathan Williams. Kevin's one-act play, Three Lunatics Discussing Philosophy, was chosen to be performed as the Capital Stage Apprentice Showcase, which he also directed. He continues to live and work as a theatrical artist in the Sacramento region. </p>
